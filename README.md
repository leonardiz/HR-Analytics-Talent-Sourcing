## ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATION

Based on our data analysis, we have identified the following key findings and recommendations for 10Alytics:

- The organization has experienced steady growth in its workforce over the years, but it needs to diversify its sourcing channels and target more entry-level and senior-level candidates.
- **Agile** is the most sought-after skill among top-performing employees, and it should be prioritized in the hiring criteria and training programs.
- The promotion rate has been inconsistent and low over the years, and it needs to be improved to increase employee motivation and retention.
- There is a positive correlation between educational background and performance scores, and the organization should partner with reputable universities and institutions to source high-quality candidates.
- The overall average employee satisfaction score is **7.8** out of **10**, which is good but not excellent. The organization should focus on improving the satisfaction levels of the employees in the Sales and Marketing department, which has the lowest average score of 6.5.
